Light mode / dark mode
Arrays/objects - allow switching to "toString" display.
Configure chainspec

Better diff:
  - map state fields into state keys
  - compare values of serialized state instead of current `isDeepEqual`
  - diff inside arrays


Services display.
  - input a list of services (can we figure that out automatically?)
  - inputs for preimages, storage and lookup history to observe (per service)
  - display service info
